    You've told us that the worker's business could arrange and pay for a substitute to work on this engagement, and that the end client would accept it. This suggests that the end client is engaging the worker on a business to business basis, rather than on a personal service basis.

<div class="indent-warning">
    <p>
        If HMRC investigate this engagement, the end client will need to confirm that they would accept substitution. They may also be asked to demonstrate that they have accepted substitution during this, or a similar engagement.

    It is important to demonstrate that it is the worker's business that will pay, and provide the substitute, not the agency, and not the end client
