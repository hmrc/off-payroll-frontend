    You've told us that the worker's business has arranged and paid for a substitute to work on this engagement, and that the end client accepted it. This suggests that the end client is engaging the worker on a business to business basis, rather than on a personal service basis.

        If HMRC investigate this engagement, the worker and the end client will need to demonstrate that paid substitution has happened.
