    Youâ€™ve told us that the worker's business must make a significant capital investment to work on this engagement. These costs cannot be claimed back from the end client or an agency. Workers who risk their own money by, for example, buying assets, or paying for overheads and materials are acting more like a business in their own account and are likely to be self-employed for tax purposes.
