personalServiceCluster.title=About substitutes and helpers
personalServiceCluster.summary=We ask these questions to find out if the worker is being engaged as a business or on a personal service basis. If the end client hasn''t or wouldn''t agree to the worker’s business arranging for a paid substitute to work instead of them, it suggests that they''re being engaged on a personal service basis. 

controlCluster.title=About the work arrangements

financialRiskCluster.title=About the worker''s financial risk
financialRiskCluster.summary=We ask these questions to identify the level of financial risk the worker must take during this engagement. Workers who don''t risk their own money by, for example, buying assets, or paying for overheads and materials are more likely to be employed for tax purposes.
