    <p>Being an office holder isn’t about the physical place where the work is done, it's about the worker's responsibilities within the organisation. Office holders can be appointed on a permanent or temporary basis.</p>
    <p>This engagement will include performing office holder duties for the end client, if:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>the worker has a position of responsibility for the end client, including board membership or statutory board membership, or being appointed as a treasurer, trustee, company director, company secretary, or other similar statutory roles</li>
        <li>the role is created by statute, articles of association, trust deed or from documents that establish an organisati­­on (a director or company secretary, for example)</li>
        <li>the role exists even if someone isn't engaged to fill it (a club treasurer, for example)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're not sure if these things apply, please ask the end client’s management about their organisational structure.</p>
